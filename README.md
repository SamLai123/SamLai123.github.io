## A brief self-introduction

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at Columbia IEOR. My research interest lies broadly in Operations Research, especially Optimization, Optimal Contral and Financial Mathematics. I did my undergraduate in Mathematics (with a minor in Finance) at the University of Hong Kong, where I graduated with First Class Honors.
