## Self-introduction

I am Lexiao Lai, a Ph.D. student at [Columbia IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/). My research interest lies broadly in Operations Research, especially in Optimization. I completed my undergraduate at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Finance. And I graduated with First Class Honors.

At Columbia, I am working with [Prof. Cédric Josz](https://sites.google.com/site/cedricjosz/) on nonconvex optimization problems. Please refer to my [CV](/Lai_Lexiao_CV_08082020.pdf) for more details.
